## Overview
- This presentation contains documentation for the `Titanic Survival Prediction` application. The application can be found [**here on Shiny**](https://nidabatt.shinyapps.io/shinyLM/).
- The `Data Source` for `Titanic` is downloaded [**here from Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
- The source code for `Data Prepration`, `ui.R` and `server.R` is available at the [**here at the Github repo**](https://github.com/NidaBat/Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch).

## Titanic Data Summary
```{r echo=FALSE}
titanic <-read.csv("train.test_com.csv", header = TRUE)
```
This data set contains the information about `r nrow(titanic)` passengers with `r ncol(titanic)` variables:
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE}
head(titanic)
```
## Titanic Survival Prediction Functionality
The application is built using `Logistic Regression Model` from `Titanic` dataset and it predicts wether the passenger onboard Titanic survived or not. The application allows the user to select:

- Passenger Class - Family Size - Title - Age - Port of Embarkation - Sex
- Based on the above selection, the model predicts whether the passenger survived or not (1: Survived, 0: Not Survived).
- User can also see the scatter plot to visualize the survival probability of the passengers.
