# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

## Set the working directory

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/coursera")
```
## Load the data

```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
head(activity)
```

## View the data
```{r}
str(activity)

```

```{r}
summary(activity)
```


## Convert date class to 'Date'
```{r}
activity$date <- as.Date(as.character(activity$date))
```
## Mean total number of steps taken per day

###1 Calculate total number of steps per day
```{r}
stepsPerDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
head(stepsPerDay)
```
###2 Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r fig1, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5, fig.align = "center"}
hist(stepsPerDay$steps, border="black", col="grey", breaks=10, xlab="Total Steps", ylab="Frequency of Steps", main = "Total number of Steps each day")
```
###3 Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
mean(stepsPerDay$steps)
```
```{r}
median(stepsPerDay$steps)
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern

###1 Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
#### Calculate the average number of steps taken
```{r}
averageSteps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
head(averageSteps)
```
#### Compute the time series plot
```{r fig2, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5, fig.align = "center"}
plot(averageSteps$interval, averageSteps$steps,  type = "l", col="black", xlab ="Interval", ylab="Average number of steps", main = "Time-series for steps taken")
```
###2 Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps
```{r}
averageSteps[which.max(averageSteps$steps),]$interval
```
## Imputing missing values

###1 Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
```{r}
length(which(is.na(activity$steps)))
```
###2 Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset
```{r}
options(digits = 2)
activity$newSteps<- ifelse(is.na(activity$steps), mean(activity$steps, na.rm = TRUE), activity$steps)
head(activity, 10)
```
###3 Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in
```{r}
newActivity <- activity[,-1]
head(newActivity)
```
###4 Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
#### Calculate total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
newStepsPerDay <- aggregate(newSteps ~ date, newActivity, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
newStepsPerDay$newSteps<- as.numeric(newStepsPerDay$newSteps)
head(newStepsPerDay)
```
#### Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r fig3, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5, fig.align = "center"}
hist(newStepsPerDay$newSteps, border="black", col="grey", breaks=10, xlab="Total Steps", ylab="Frequency of Steps", main = "Total number of Steps each day")
```
#### Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
mean(newStepsPerDay$newSteps)
```
```{r}
median(newStepsPerDay$newSteps)
```
. There is no significant impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
###1 Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r}
newActivity$day <-  ifelse(as.POSIXlt(newActivity$date)$wday %in% c(0,6), 'weekend', 'weekday')
newActivity$day <- as.factor(newActivity$day)
str(newActivity)
```
###2 Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

#### Load the package
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```
#### Generate the time series plot using 'ggplot' function 
```{r fig4, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, fig.align = "center"}
averageNewSteps <- aggregate(newSteps ~ interval + day, newActivity, mean)
p <- ggplot(averageNewSteps, aes(interval, newSteps)) 
   p + geom_line() + 
    facet_grid(day ~ .) +
    xlab("5-minute interval") + 
    ylab("Average number of steps")+
    ggtitle("Time series plot")
   ```
